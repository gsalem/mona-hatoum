      <p>Wordplay, multiple resonance and multiple meaning run all through Hatoum’s use of language. Light Sentence 1992 puns in both its title and its form on cages, prisons, electricity and a forced weightlessness in the world – ‘the feeling of not being able to take anything for granted, even doubting the solidity of the ground you walk on’, as Hatoum put it in an interview in 1997. Likewise, the two versions of You Are Still Here 2006 – with exactly these words of its title engraved on their mirrored surfaces, one elegant in Arabic, one more perfunctory in English – act as stimulus to a layered existential kind of reflecting as well as literal reflection. After all, are these words proof that you’re ‘here’, or alive? A reminder that you won’t always be? A reassurance? An admonition for your not having moved on already? An answer to a question you didn’t even know you were asking, in a casual glance at yourself in a mirror on a wall?
