      Mona Hatoum was born in Beirut, to a Palestinian family. She attended Beirut University College from 1970 to 1972. She came to Britain as a student in the mid-1970s, settling in London in 1975 when civil war in the Lebanon made her return home impossible. She studied at the Byam Shaw School of Art from 1975 to 1979 and at the Slade School of Art from 1979 to 1981. Throughout the 1980s she held a number of artist's residencies in Britain, Canada and the United States. Hatoum has occupied part-time teaching positions in London, Maastricht, and Cardiff, where she was Senior Fellow at Cardiff Institute of Higher Education from 1989 to 1992, and in the mid-1990s she taught at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris.

      Hatoum's pieces are concerned with confrontational themes such as violence, oppression and voyeurism, often in reference to the human body. Conflict arises from the juxtaposition of opposites such as beauty and horror, desire and revulsion. Until 1988 Hatoum worked mainly with video and performance. Since 1989 she has concentrated on making installations, the first group of which were exhibited in 1992 at the Chapter Gallery, Cardiff. She has created a number of works using metalgrids which allude to physical violence and imprisonment, notably Light Sentence (1992). She has also explored these themes in a number of smaller sculptures based on items of furniture, such as Incommunicado (1993, Tate Gallery T06988). She has had solo exhibitions at the Chapter Gallery, Cardiff (1992), the Arnolfini, Bristol (1993) and the Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris (1994), as well as at a number of venues across Canada. In 1995 she was shortlisted for the Turner Prize at the Tate Gallery. She lives in London.

      Hatoum challenges the movements of surrealism and minimalism, making work which explores the conflicts and contradictions of our world. Her studies at the Slade School of Art coincided with developing ideas around gender and race, and she began to explore the relationship between politics and the individual through performance.</p><p>
      In the late 1980s she began to make installations and sculptures in a wide range of materials. These often use the grid or geometric forms to reference to systems of control within society. She has made a number of works using household objects which are scaled up or changed to make them familiar but uncanny.
      </p><p>
      In addition, her works explore themes of home and displacement through the perspective of the Palestinian exile, using common domestic objects that often, on closer inspection, reveal menacing qualities. Hatoum’s collection of sculptures and installations incorporates motifs of containment and violence, from steel cages and sandbag walls to barbed wire and grenades. Mobile Home (2005), an installation arranged between two steel barriers, features nondescript pieces of furniture and household items framed above and below by a pulley system. Complete with clothespins, the wires are strung between the tops of the barriers and along the floor and traverse the space, carrying such unexpected objects as a toy and a tiny birdcage. The result is an evocation of home that is both comforting and untenable, suggesting transience and vulnerability.
      </p><p>
      The social and political dynamics of her life have almost certainly contributed to leitmotifs in her work: issues of power relationships, dislocation, and human interactions, whether related to war, refugee status, or domestic unrest. In Hatoum’s hands, seemingly familiar objects—kitchen utensils, office lockers, scarves, beds—are transformed into extraordinary and often menacing sculptures. They may be enlarged to gargantuan proportions, composed of incongruous materials; or their practical function may be obfuscated.
      “You can’t take things for granted,” Hatoum explains. “You have to look behind the surface. I want people to have a gut reaction to the work first, and after that initial experience, they can start to think about what it might mean.”</p>
